	<h2 style="line-height: 80px;">The beginning of Joshua Alcala</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> As a young man, Joshua Alcala had dreamed of being a teacher to bully innocent children. He had wished to see tears come down their chubby little cheeks and laugh as they noticed their beautiful grade drop down by 0.001% turning a beautiful A- into a ugly B+. Now his dream has come true and is taking place to this very day. But in order for any story to take place it must have a beginning, a place where it all started. Joshua Alcala's mother was never interested for him to be a teacher. She wanted him to learn how to pull concrete and mow lawns, but little Josh just didn't want that. He wanted to inflict pain to kids mentally because he was just too short to manage to inflict them physically. You may wonder dear reader about how I know this much about Joshua Alcala but my responce is short and sweet. I know this man because I am the one who aids him when he inflicts pain to the little midgets he teaches. Now back to the story, Josh had three wishes of his future job. The first one was a baseball stadium translator, Josh had loved baseball ever since he was a kid and this was his number one dream. The second job Josh had wanted was being a video editor. Josh had seen many people edit incredible movies in his time and just seeing how it was done interested him. The final job that Josh wanted was being a teacher so he cound inflict pain on kids mentally.</p>
	 <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> Now since you know why Joshua Alcala wanted to be a teacher, we should continue the story about his childhood. I was given many information about his childhood when he told me his stories. There are a couple stories about him when he was younger but the youngest one he has ever told me was when he was in kindergarten. The stories goes by talking about how Joshua was never given the opportunity to go play with his friends. Never, but at the same time he was in kindergarten. But one special day Josh asks his mother if he can go play with his friend name Philp and his mother had said yes. Now, Josh's mother was a stern women, she never let anyone of her children to do what they wanted unless she thought it was the right thing or if her child had asked permission first. And playing with friends after school wasn't at the top of her list. Even Mr. Alcala himself didn't expect her to say yes. Josh bolted out the door running straight to his firend's Philp's car cheering as he went. Philp then remembered that he had asked Josh to comer over to his house so Philip also cheered, but Philip's mother just wasn't having it. She told Philip that Josh couldn't come over to play today because she had to take Philip to the docter that day. The next part of the story Mr.Alcala said was something that he will never forget until he died. Philip screamed at his mother and took off all of his clothes in the middle of the street infront of the kindergarten. Philip was butt naked in the street screaming his head off with his little tushy bouncing up and down in incoming traffic. "It was quite a sight for a 5 year old to see" Mr. Alcala said smiling. By then Josh's mother had heard of Philip's screams and ran out of her car to pick Josh up and throw him in the back so they could leave. That's where the story ends, Mr.Alcala stated that he had never seen Philip and his tiny round tushy ever again after that specaisl kindergarten day.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> As you can see, Joshua Alcala's youngest story he has ever told me was a complete adventure. Just you wait until I tell you about how he got kidnapped by a grandma, vacumummed up a dead grandma, watch a child nuture a hamster to death, kill a dog by accident, and how a random Chinese women has a picture of him proposing to his wife.</p>
